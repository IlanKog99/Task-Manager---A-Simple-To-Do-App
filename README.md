# Task Manager

A lightweight, GUI-based task manager built with **CustomTkinter**. Easily add, edit, delete, and track tasks with priority levels, due dates, and persistent storage.

## Future Plans

---

- **Settings file** to store user preferences (colors, task visibility, etc.).
- **Dedicated Settings menu** in the app for easier configuration.
- **Custom user paths** for:
  - tasks.json storage location.
  - tasks.txt export file destination.
- **Duplicate task detection**: Notify users about duplicate tasks and handle them appropriately.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Priority Sorting**: Tasks sorted by urgency (High, Normal, Low).
- **Color-Coded System**:
  - ðŸ”´ Overdue tasks
  - ðŸŸ  Due within 30 days
  - ðŸ”µ Due beyond 30 days
  - âšª No due date
  - âœ… Completed tasks
- **Search & Filtering**: Find tasks quickly by description.
- **Export Tasks**: Save incomplete tasks to a formatted text file.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks stored in a JSON file in the app directory.
- **Configurable settings**: Show/hide completed tasks, disable colors for a plain view.
- **Modular code design**: Each class is in its own file for better maintainability.
