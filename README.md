# Task Manager

A lightweight, GUI-based task manager built with **CustomTkinter**. Easily add, edit, delete, and track tasks with priority levels, due dates, and persistent storage.

## Future Plans

- **Settings file** to store user preferences (colors, task visibility, etc.).
- **Dedicated Settings menu** in the app for easier configuration.
- **Custom user paths** for:
  - tasks.json storage location.
  - tasks.txt export file destination.
- **Duplicate task detection**: Warn users if a task already exists before adding it.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Priority Sorting**: Sort tasks by urgency (High, Normal, Low).

  - ðŸ”´ Overdue tasks
  - ðŸŸ  Due within 30 days

- **Search & Filtering**: Quickly find tasks by description.
- **Export Tasks**: Save incomplete tasks to a text file.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file for future use.
